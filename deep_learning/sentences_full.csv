Great case and price!,positive
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,negative

The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,positive
And none of the tones is acceptable.,negative
camera color balance is AWFUL.,negative
"This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.",negative
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,positive
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,negative
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,positive

lightweight and works well.,positive
So just beware.,negative

It was a great phone.,positive
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,negative
"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.",positive
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,positive
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,positive
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,negative
"In the span of an hour,"" I had two people exclaim """"Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?""",positive
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,positive

I am sorry I made this purchase.,negative
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,negative
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,negative
It was horrible!.,negative
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,negative
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,negative
They work about 2 weeks then break.,negative
It is simple to use and I like it.,positive
"It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!",positive

My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,positive
Service sucks.,negative
The shrimp tender and moist.,positive

Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,positive
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,negative

walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,negative
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,negative
This place has it!,positive
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,negative
